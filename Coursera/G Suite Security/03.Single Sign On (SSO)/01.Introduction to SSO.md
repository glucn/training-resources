Single Sign On (SSO) is a great benefit for your users, streamlining the login process through eliminating effort to remember different user account names and passwords across multiple apps.

In any SSO environment, there is what is known as an Identity Provider (IdP) and a Service Provider (SP). In the case of G Suite Marketplace apps, Google is the IdP as your users sign in with their Google credentials once and can then access the Marketplace apps offered by other service providers.

Alternatively, an organization may already use a 3rd party SSO service. In this case Google would be the SP, granting access to G Suite services such as Gmail and Calendar after a user has successfully signed into the 3rd party SSO system.

In this lesson you will learn how to setup SSO using Google as an IdP. You will also see the steps required to add a 3rd party IdP to your G Suite account and you should understand the differences between the two options.

If you are unable to complete all of the steps in these exercises due to your own organization's current systems and needs, you should still read through and explore the areas where these exercises are pointing you. If you don't have immediate SSO needs, you will still find it valuable to understand where to enable SSO in the future.
