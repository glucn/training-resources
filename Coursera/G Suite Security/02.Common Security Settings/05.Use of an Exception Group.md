## Introduction

In the previous exercise you applied a 2SV enforcement policy to a single OU. This works well but consider a situation where you want to apply the policy to only some members of an OU. You could move the users who are not required to enroll into another OU but then you have a situation where you need to manage policies for multiple OUs where previously you had everyone in one place. This adds to the complexity of your organizational structure so is not desirable.

The solution to this challenge is to use an exception group. Exception groups augment the ability to turn on or off services by OU. The approach is fairly straightforward. You would:

1\. Create a group and put all users who are exempt enrollment into that group.

2\. Enforce the policy for the OU.

3\. Disable enforcement for the group. The policy settings you give to the group are applied to the intersection of the OU and group (members of both).

The same approach could be used if you wanted to enforce enrollment for a subset of OU members only. In that case you enforce for the group but turn enforcement off for the OU.
