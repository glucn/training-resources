Google Vault is a service that lets you retain, hold, search, and export data to support your organization's archiving and eDiscovery needs. Vault is used for:

-   Archiving: Set retention rules to control how long data is retained before being removed from user accounts and deleted from Google systems. See [How retention works](https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2990828 "How retention works")

-   Legal holds: Place holds on users to preserve their data indefinitely in order to meet legal or other retention obligations. Learn about holds. See [Place Gmail and classic Hangouts on hold](https://support.google.com/vault/answer/2473591 "Place Gmail and classic Hangouts on hold")

-   Search and Export: Search your domain's data by user account, organizational unit, date, or keyword. Vault supports Boolean and wildcard operator searches. See [Get started with search and export](https://support.google.com/vault/answer/6161352 "Get started with search and export")

Vault supports Gmail and classic Hangouts (with history on), Drive, Groups, Hangouts Chat (with history on), and Hangouts Meet.
