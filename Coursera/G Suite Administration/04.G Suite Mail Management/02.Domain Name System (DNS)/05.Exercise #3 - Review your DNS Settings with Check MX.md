## Introduction

In this exercise you will check the status of your DNS records using the Check MX utility which is provided as part of the G Suite toolbox. Check MX analyses your DNS configuration and makes recommendations for changes where appropriate.

## Directions

1\. Open a new browser tab and visit <https://toolbox.googleapps.com/apps/checkmx/>

2\. Enter the name of your G Suite domain into the 'Domain name' field, and click RUN CHECKS!. After a few seconds, you will see the results displayed.

The image below shows expected results for a new domain that was purchased as part of the sign up flow. Note that exact results can vary depending upon your registrar and existing DNS configuration. In the next lesson we will focus on the first three entries in the list as these relate directly to email security.
