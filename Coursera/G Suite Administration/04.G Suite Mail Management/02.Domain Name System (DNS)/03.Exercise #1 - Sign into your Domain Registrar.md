## Introduction

As mentioned previously, It's important to understand that whilst in some instances you can update your DNS records directly from the G Suite admin console, your DNS records are always hosted and managed outside of G Suite with a DNS registrar such as GoDaddy, and eNom.

In this exercise you will sign into your domain registrar. How you do that will depend upon whether you purchased your domain when you signed up for the G Suite trial account, or whether you are using an existing domain for this training.

## Directions

If you purchased your domain as part of the sign up flow, complete the following steps:

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. Click the Domains icon.

3\. Click Add/remove domains or the Manage Domains icon.

4\. Click the Advanced DNS settings section. Make a note of your sign in credentials.

5\. Click the Sign in to DNS console and sign in to your registrar to view your domain's DNS records.

If you are using an existing domain sign directly into your registrar as normal.
