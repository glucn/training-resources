In the previous lesson you saw how you can improve the security of your outbound messages by implementing SPF, DKIM, and then DMARC. Together these features allow recipient mail servers to check the messages they receive were actually sent from your organization and have not been tampered with in transit.

In this lesson we will look at how you can protect your users from inbound phishing and harmful software (malware). There are a number of different types of threats to your users. For example, a message may contain a harmful attachment or a link to an untrusted domain. Using Google's advanced phishing and malware protection options you can choose what actions to take when a phishing mail or malware is detected.

You will also explore the end user access features available to your users, which include:

-   POP/IMAP access - allow users to connect desktop apps to Gmail

-   G Suite Sync for Microsoft Outlook - allow users to work with Gmail from Microsoft Outlook

-   Gmail offline access
