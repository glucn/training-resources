## Introduction

In the previous exercise, you added a sender's public IP address to the email whitelist for Gmail to avoid messages from that sender from being marked as spam. In this exercise you will learn how to create an approved sender list for your organization.

The key difference between an email whitelist and approved sender list is that you can add email addresses and domain names to an approved sender list where the whitelist uses IP addresses only.

## Directions

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. Click the Apps icon, click the G Suite icon and then click the Gmail service.

3\. Scroll down and click Advanced settings.

4\. Scroll down to the 'Spam, phishing, and malware' section.

5\. Hover over the 'Spam' row and click CONFIGURE.

6\. Enter a short description, for example *Approved senders*.

The Spam setting provides the following options. You can enable any or all of them:

-   Be more aggressive when filtering spam: The default is disabled. If you enable this option, it's likely that more messages will be marked spam and sent to your users' spam folders.
-   Bypass spam filters for messages received from internal senders: Internal mail is not checked for spam.
-   Bypass spam filters for messages received from addresses or domains within these approved senders lists: We will be using this option here.
-   Put spam in administrative quarantine: If you select this option, spam messages are never directed to users' spam folders.

7\. Check the 'Bypass spam filters for messages received from addresses or domains within these approved senders lists' box and click the Use existing or create a new one link.

8\. Enter a name for the list *Approved senders*, and click CREATE.

9\. Once the list appears in the dialog box, hover the list name, and click Edit. You can now manage the list.

10\. Initially the list is empty. Click Add to add a list entry.

11\. Enter one or more domain names or user email addresses external to your organization that you trust and click SAVE. Separate multiple values with a comma or space.

12\. Click ADD SETTING and click SAVE.

You have just successfully created an approved sender list for your organization.

## Notes

1\. Sender authentication protects you from spoofed email; namely, email that appears to be from a valid sender but really isn't. By default, sender authentication is enabled for new entries in an address list. Without sender authentication (where DMARC checks fail), Gmail has no way of knowing if the message was really sent by the person it claims to have come from. Because of this, a sender is only considered to match your address list if their mail is authenticated. Although you can do it, Google strongly recommends that you not turn off sender authentication.

2\. In addition to being able to configure a spam setting that tells Gmail to be more aggressive when filtering spam, Gmail also provides the option for enhanced pre-delivery message scanning. See [Use enhanced pre-delivery message scanning](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7380368 "Use enhanced pre-delivery message scanning") for more details.
