There are hundreds of applications available that integrate with G Suite services. These apps may be cloud based enterprise apps, marketplace apps, or custom apps.

As the administrator you are responsible for protecting your user's data so it is important that you understand best practices for application integration.

In this lesson you will learn how to control access to the admin console from the Admin SDK API. You will also learn how to block access to a specific service (for example, Drive or Calendar) by turning off API access to that service whilst at the same time allowing trusted apps to use that API by creating a trusted application list.

Finally you will explore the G Suite Marketplace. You will install a marketplace app for your entire organization and create a marketplace whitelist which controls the applications that users can install from the marketplace onto their company managed devices.
