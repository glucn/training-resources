In this lesson you will explore some of the tools that are available to you in the admin console that help you keep your information secure.

You will start by looking at the security center from where you can see high level dashboard of security related events such as spam metrics and failed device login attempts. You will drill into the dashboard and filter the data for each report to show the results of interest to you.

You will explore the security health page which provides an overview of your security-related settings and gives recommendations where appropriate, and you will be introduced to the security investigation tool which can be used to identify, triage, and take action on security and privacy issues in your organization.

You will be introduced to the alert center and you will review the accounts activity report which is an aid to monitor your users' account settings and exposure to security risks.
