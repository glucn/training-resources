## Introduction

The admin console home page shows controls or icons that launch various administrator settings, and has links to tools and common administrative tasks.

The first time you first sign in to the admin console, only the default most commonly used controls are visible. You can add new controls and hide any that you don't need. You can also move the controls on the screen to suit your desired ordering.

## Directions

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/). The first time you first sign in to the admin console, only a few controls or icons are visible in the dashboard.

2\. Click MORE CONTROLS at the bottom of the page to reveal hidden controls.

3\. Drag and drop the following icons up into the main area of the page:

-   Buildings and Resources
-   Reports
-   Rules
-   Security

Tip: If you move your mouse cursor over a hidden control a small gray + sign will be revealed on the top-right of the control's icon. Clicking the + sign adds the control to main page so you don't need to drag and drop.

Your admin console should look similar to this. Don't worry if you forgot an icon, you can always move it later.

4\. Click the three horizontal lines on the top left of the screen to reveal the side menu. This menu makes it easier to see, find, and directly navigate to the information and settings in your admin console:

-   Easily scan a shorter, multi-layered menu that helps you find things quickly.
-   Quickly find what you're looking for by hovering over and clicking through the menu to drill down directly to the pages you want to see.
-   The streamlined menu removes clutter for delegated admins so they will only see the menu items they have access to with their level of administrative privileges.

Tip: Click Google Admin at the top left of the screen to return the home page at any time, or click Home from the side menu.
