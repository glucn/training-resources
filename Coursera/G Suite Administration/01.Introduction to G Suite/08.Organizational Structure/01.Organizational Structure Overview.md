## Introduction

Initially all your users are placed in a single organization. All settings you make in the admin console apply to this top-level organization and therefore to all users in your G Suite account.

A single organization can be limiting however so you may want to create an organizational structure by adding organizational units (OUs) to your G Suite account. There are several reasons why you would do this, for example:

-   To control which applications and services are available to users
-   To configure the available services differently for different sets of users

You can create as many organizational units as you want, either at the same level or in a hierarchy. Each child OU inherits settings from its parent. Changing a setting at a higher level changes the setting for all child OUs unless you have overridden inheritance and customized settings for the child OU.

A single user exists in one OU only.

In this module you will create two organizational units (OUs) for your company, and place users into each OU according to their job role. You will also learn how to disable a Google service for an individual OU.
