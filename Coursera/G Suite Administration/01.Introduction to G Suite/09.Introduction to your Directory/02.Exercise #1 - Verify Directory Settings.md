## Introduction

In this exercise, you will confirm that contact sharing is enabled for your organization.

## Directions

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. From the menu (top left) select Directory > Directory settings.

3\. Click Sharing settings.

4\. Ensure that 'Enable contact sharing' is selected. If it is disabled, enable it now.

In this section you can also specify which information is shared. For example, you can choose whether to show or hide email aliases, and if you have multiple domains in your organization you can share the entire directory across all domains or restrict sharing to the domain level only (i.e. users in one domain only see other users in that same domain).

5\. Click SAVE if you have made any changes.

## Notes

1.  Changes can take 24 hours to propagate to all users.
