## Introduction

Your organization's directory will store information about users in your G Suite account but it is very likely that you will deal with users from outside of the organization on a regular basis.

Google provide the [Domain Shared Contacts API](http://code.google.com/googleapps/domain/shared_contacts/gdata_shared_contacts_api_reference.html "Domain Shared Contacts API") which allows you to add external contacts your directory. These external contacts will then be presented to your users in services such as Gmail when completing addresses.

In addition to using the API directly to create your external contacts you can also use GCDS. There are a number of third party apps available which will add this information to your directory.

## Notes

Each user can also manage their own personal contacts list where they can add external recipient information.
