## Introduction

In the lessons that follow, you'll learn how to provision (add) users, groups and resources in your G Suite domain. Later in the course we will cover users, groups and resource management in more detail.

## Before you get started

In these exercises, as a G Suite administrator you have control over the user passwords. To avoid confusion or being locked out of an account, it's best to keep a consistent policy for password creation. For these exercises, the default password for all new users is *hellohello1*, unless you choose the auto-generated temporary password option. Feel free to choose your own new password, but do remember to take note of it!

The free trial G Suite account you're using for this course is free for up to 10 users. For more information, see the[ About your free G Suite trial help center article](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6388094?hl=en).
