## Introduction

The Google Groups service includes:

-   Admin console groups: Groups used for communication, collaboration, and administration. Administrators create and manage these groups in the admin console. Learn more [about Admin groups](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33329?hl=en&ref_topic=14869#Admin).
-   Groups for Business (managed by administrators and users): Groups used for communication and collaboration. When you turn on Groups for Business, you and your users can manage group features in Google Groups ([groups.google.com](https://groups.google.com/ "Google Groups")). Learn more about [Groups for Business](https://support.google.com/a/answer/33329?hl=en&ref_topic=14869#Groups).

Groups can be created from the admin console, from the Google Groups for Business service, or using the [Admin SDK Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/manage-groups "Admin SDK Directory API"). GCDS can also be used to sync admin groups from any LDAP compliant directory to G Suite.

In this lesson you will also create two groups for your organization from the admin console. We will look at group settings later in this course.
