## Introduction

As the administrator, you can let users work in certain Google products with users from other G Suite domains outside of your organization. For example, you can allow file sharing in Google Drive with organizations that you trust by first whitelisting their domain, then granting them sharing access. Users in trusted organizations can also share their files with users in your domain.

## Directions

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at[ admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. Click the Domains icon.

3\. Click Whitelisted external domains or the Whitelisted domains icon.

4\. Enter the name of a trusted domain you want to whitelist and click ADD.

5\. Click SAVE.

## Notes

1\. You can whitelist a maximum of 50 domains.

2\. Whitelisted domains must be G Suite domains only.

3\. A primary domains' subdomains and domain aliases aren't included when you whitelist a domain. You must add each domain individually if needed.

4\. You can turn whitelisting off or on at the organizational unit level but the domain whitelist applies to the whole organization (all OUs). There aren't separate whitelists for each OU.
