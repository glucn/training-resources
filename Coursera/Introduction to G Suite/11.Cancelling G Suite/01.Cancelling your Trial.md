## Introduction

As discussed at the beginning of the course, your G Suite trial period lasts for 14 days. At the end of that time you will be charged unless you have cancelled your subscription.

If you do not intend to take the additional courses in the G Suite Admin specialization or if your trial period is about to expire and you want to avoid charges, you should cancel your subscription now.
