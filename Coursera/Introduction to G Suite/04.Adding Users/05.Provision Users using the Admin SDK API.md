## Introduction

G Suite includes many Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that allow customers and third party developers to integrate with G Suite services and data. One of these APIs is the [Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/) which can be used to automate administrative operations on users, groups, organizational units, and devices in your G Suite account. Included in the Admin SDK is the [Directory API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/) which includes methods to create and manage your user accounts.

GCDS actually uses the Directory API to provision and manage user accounts as part of the sync process.

It is beyond the scope of this training to go into depth on this topic but if you are interested in using any of the G Suite APIs there are some useful resources below.
