## Introduction

The G Suite directory contains profile information for users in your organization, Google group addresses, plus details of any shared contacts that you add. You can think of it as a global address book.

In addition to names and email addresses, profiles can contain other information such as employee ID, manager details, location, etc. This information helps people find one another, communicate with one another, and understand each others role in the organization. As an administrator, you can add user information and control user visibility in Contacts and other Google services.

When contact sharing is enabled:

-   Individual and group addresses autocomplete as users enter them in Google services like Gmail, Google Docs, and Drive.
-   Calendar intelligently suggests meeting rooms based on the location and number of guests.
-   Users can find profile information in Contacts and other Google services. For example, when users point at or tap someone's profile photo, they open a person information card.

In this lesson you will explore your directory's sharing and visibility settings. You will also complete a number of exercises where you will allow users to update their own profiles and also create a custom directory for a subset of your users.
