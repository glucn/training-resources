## Introduction

As the G Suite administrator, you use the admin console to activate services, add users, configure features, and much more. The last step in Exercise #1 will have taken you into your admin console. If you have logged out, complete the following exercise to log back in.

## Directions

1\. Open a web browser window and go to [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. Enter your G Suite administrator account email address and click Next.

3\. Enter your administrator password and click Next. The admin console displays.

## Notes

1.  You will normally sign into the admin console from [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/). However, if you're already signed in to another G Suite service you can also access the admin console by clicking the Admin icon that can be found in the Apps Launcher.
2.  If you have problems signing in, see the following article: [Can't sign in to the Admin console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/6335621 "Can't sign in to the Admin console").
3.  Only a user with administrator privileges can access the admin console. As the domain administrator, you can grant administrator privileges to any of your users. We will discuss this later in the course.
