## Introduction

Administrator roles give a user privileges to manage another user's access to G Suite or to perform actions that affect the setup of your organization's G Suite account. You can make a user either a super administrator with complete access to the G Suite account, or you can assign a role that limits which administrative tasks the user can perform.
