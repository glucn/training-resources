In this reading we will cover the DNS records used by G Suite and describe the purpose of each.

## DNS records that impact mail delivery

#### MX Record

Mail Exchange (MX) records direct email to the servers hosting your user accounts. To set up Gmail if you have G Suite, you need to point your MX records to the Google mail servers. Multiple MX records can be defined for a domain, each with a different priority. If mail can't be delivered using the highest priority record, the second priority record is used, and so on.

#### TXT Record

A TXT record is a DNS record that provides text information to sources outside your domain, that can be used for a number of arbitrary purposes. G Suite uses TXT records for a variety of purposes such as domain verification and to implement email security measures such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC which we will discuss later.

#### CNAME Record

A CNAME or Canonical Name record links an alias name to another true or canonical domain name. For instance, www.example.com might link to example.com. With G Suite services you use CNAME records to customize a Google service address or the address of a website built with Google Sites.

## Other DNS record types

#### A Record

An A or Address record (also known as a host record) links a domain to the physical IP address of a computer hosting that domain's services.

#### NS Record

Name server (NS) records determine which servers will communicate DNS information for a domain. Generally, you have primary and secondary name server records for your domain. When using G Suite you may configure NS records that point to Google servers for DNS queries.

## Example DNS configuration

Here are sample DNS settings for a domain used with G Suite. Note in the first column that you don't use the actual domain name in your DNS settings. Instead, you use the @ symbol (or leave it blank) to indicate the domain name.

## Notes

1\. If you purchase your domain as part of the G Suite sign up flow, Google will automatically add the correct records for you. If you already own the domain, you will normally need to configure your DNS records to work with G Suite.
