DNS stands for *Domain Name System*. This system is essentially the phone book of the Web that organizes and identifies domains. While a phone book translates a name like "Acme Pizza" into the correct phone number to call, the DNS translates a web address like "www.google.com" into the physical IP address such as "74.125.19.147" of the computer hosting that site (in this case, the Google homepage).

As the administrator, it is important that you have an understanding of your organization's DNS configuration, in particular how that configuration works with G Suite mail.

When using G Suite services, you may need to modify your DNS settings to set up various tools and services. You do this by changing your DNS records. For example, you change your domain's Mail Exchanger (MX) records to direct email for your domain to Google's mail servers.

It's important to understand that whilst in some instances you can update your DNS records directly from the G Suite admin console, your DNS records are always hosted and managed outside of G Suite with a DNS registrar such as Go Daddy, and eNom.

In this lesson you will learn about the key types of DNS records that G Suite requires.

Important: It is assumed that you are using a trial G Suite account and a test domain for this training. If you are using a live/production domain, DO NOT make any changes to any of your DNS records.
