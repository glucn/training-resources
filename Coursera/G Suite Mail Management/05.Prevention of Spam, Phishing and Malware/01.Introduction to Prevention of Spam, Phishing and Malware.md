All mail sent to your users is subject to Google's spam filters. By default, and messages that are identified as spam are delivered to the user's Gmail spam folder. Spam messages are automatically deleted from the spam folder after 30 days.

As the administrator, you can customize how spam is managed in a number ways. For example, you can:

-   Be more aggressive, for strict filtering of email. (although this may result in valid messages being identified as spam)
-   Bypass internal mail.
-   Use approved sender lists

In this lesson you will explore the advanced spam, phishing and malware controls available to you in the admin console.
