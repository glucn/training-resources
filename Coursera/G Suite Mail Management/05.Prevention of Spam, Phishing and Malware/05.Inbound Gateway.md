In most cases, mail destined for your organization will go straight to Google for delivery and as such you will configure your DNS MX records to point to the Google servers. In some cases however, you may need to use an inbound gateway. The gateway typically processes the mail in some way before passing it onto Google for delivery to Gmail. Common use cases for an inbound gateway are:

-   Message archiving
-   Spam filtering
-   During migration to G Suite where you have some users on a legacy mail server and some on Gmail

When you use an inbound gateway, you point your MX records to the inbound mail gateway server, and configure the gateway server to deliver messages to Gmail servers.

It's important if you are using an inbound gateway that you add the details to the 'Inbound gateway' setting on the Gmail Advanced settings page. Google will allow a high volume of traffic from the gateway and SPF checks are more accurate as these are made against the server that sent the message to your legacy server.

When configuring an inbound gateway, you can optionally

-   Reject mail that wasn't sent from the gateway
-   Configure how to handle spam based on gateway message tags.

The latter is useful if your gateway server adds a header to spam messages before it passes the email to Gmail. You can identify inbound spam messages using the header and optionally disable most of the Gmail spam filters for messages entering via the gateway.
