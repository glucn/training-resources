## Introduction

If you notice that legitimate emails from specific contacts are being incorrectly marked as spam, you can whitelist the contact's IP address. After you whitelist an IP address, messages originating from the IP address are no longer marked as spam. A blacklist is a list of email addresses you block from sending mail to your domain. Administrators can block domains or specific users.

In this exercise, you will create an email whitelist for your organization. You will also create a blocked senders list (blacklist) and test the results when a user in that list tries to send a message to you.

## Directions

1\. If you are not already signed in, sign in to your domain as the administrator at [admin.google.com](https://admin.google.com/).

2\. Click the Apps icon, click the G Suite icon and then click the Gmail service.

3\. Scroll down and click Advanced settings.

#### Create a whitelist

4\. Scroll down to the 'Spam, phishing, and malware' section and enter the following IP address into the 'Email whitelist' field:

-   172.217.25.142

If you want to add more IP addresses, separate entries with a comma.

5\. Click SAVE.

Messages originating from 172.217.25.142 *should* no longer be marked as spam. Please note though that Gmail will still mark as spam any message which it deems to be a blatant spam, phishing or malware message even if the sender's IP is listed in the email whitelist.

#### Create a blacklist

6\. Before we create the blacklist, send a message from an external account to your super administrators email address. Then open your inbox and confirm that you have received the message. Next we will blacklist the user that just sent the message.

7\. Hover over the 'Blocked senders' row and click CONFIGURE.

8\. Enter a short description, for example *Block me*.

9\. We must now create a list to use for this setting. Click Use existing or create a new one.

10\. Enter a name for the list *Blocked senders*, and click CREATE.

11\. Once the list appears in the dialog box, hover the list name, and click Edit. You can now manage the list.

12\. Initially the list is empty. Click Add to add a list entry.

13\. Enter the email address of your external account and click SAVE. Note: In addition to user email addresses you can also enter domain names here.

14\. Click ADD SETTING and click SAVE.

15\. Repeat Step 6. This time the message should be blocked and the sender will receive a message advising that the message could not be delivered.

16\. Hover over your blocked sender setting. Note the options on the right. You can edit, disable, copy or delete it. You can also add a new setting. Click DELETE and click SAVE.

## Notes

1\. If you want to whitelist email addresses or domains, you should create an approved senders list. We will do that in the next exercise.

2\. If you are forwarding mail to Gmail from another mail system (perhaps you are in the process of migrating users onto G Suite) you should not add your legacy server's IP address(es) to the email whitelist. Add the address(es) to the inbound gateway section instead. We will discuss the inbound gateway later in this lesson.
