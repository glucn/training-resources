There are a number of ways in which you can enhance your email security by ensuring that people who receive email from your company can verify that the email really is from your organization, and that it has not been modified along the way.

In this lesson we will look at three email security measures that are used by G Suite. We recommend that you implement all three for best protection against spoofing and spammers.

In the first exercise you will learn about the Sender Policy Framework (SPF). With an SPF record you are telling receiving mail servers which domains/servers are allowed to send mail on your behalf. Messages sent from other sources may be marked as spam.

Next you will implement the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) standard. This helps prevent email spoofing on outgoing messages by adding an encrypted header to every message sent. Recipient servers decrypt this header using the DKIM record to confirm it's validity.

Finally, you will learn how to prevent outbound spam messages using a Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) policy. DMARC policies tell email servers how to handle messages that fail SPF/DKIM checks.

Important: It is assumed that you are using a trial G Suite account and a test domain for this training. If you are using a live/production domain, DO NOT make any changes to any of your DNS records.
